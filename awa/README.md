# 6D recontruction from Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) measurements

This example uses the data from the paper [Efficient six-dimensional phase space reconstructions from experimental measurements using generative machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.27.094601). The data and accelerator model are provided under an open-source license at https://github.com/roussel-ryan/gpsr_6d_paper/tree/main.

Run:
```
python eval_gpsr.py
python train.py
python eval.py
```
